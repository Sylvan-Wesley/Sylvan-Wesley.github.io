## 🧪 About Me

A **Chinese Chemistry Olympiad** veteran now channeling that molecular intuition into the realm of **Artificial Intelligence, **freshman at Yuanpei College, Peking University. Just as simple atoms bond to form complex structures, I'm learning to weave neural architectures that think, see, and act.

From balancing equations to balancing gradients — the reaction continues.
